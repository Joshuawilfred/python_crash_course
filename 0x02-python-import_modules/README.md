# Project Name

0x02. Python - Import & Modules

## Description

This project covers the topic of importing and using modules in Python. It includes various tasks that focus on understanding the concept of importing functions, creating modules, using command line arguments, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the awesomeness of Python programming
- Import functions from another file
- Use imported functions
- Create a module
- Use the built-in function `dir()`
- Prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- Use command line arguments with Python programs

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*) style guide
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file

Write a program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`.

### 1. My first toolbox!

Write a program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, performs mathematical operations, and prints the results.

### 2. How to make a script dynamic!

Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed and lists the arguments.

### 3. Infinite addition

Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all the arguments passed to it.

### 4. Who are you?

Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

### 5. Everything can be imported

Write a program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.
