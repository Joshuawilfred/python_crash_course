# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to lists and tuples in Python. Each task focuses on different aspects of working with lists, including printing, accessing elements, replacing elements, reversing order, creating matrix, adding tuples, and more.

## Learning Objectives
By completing the tasks in this repository, you will gain a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- Working with lists in Python
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Common methods of lists and their usage
- Using lists as stacks and queues
- List comprehensions
- Working with tuples and their usage
- When to use tuples versus lists
- Understanding sequences, tuple packing, and sequence unpacking
- Using the `del` statement and its usage
